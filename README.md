# OrcGame

Small patriotic project written in Java programing language as a part of Object Oriented Programing course.

It was created using Swing and Javax Java libraries and a bit of creativity :)

Spring was used to perform dependency injection, because one of the requirements was to use a framework for DI.

Here are some of the screenshots:
